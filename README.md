# Find-max
Traversing a list to find the max (or min) is common. Given a list of integers, output the maximum integer found in the list. If the input is

4 3 8 2 6
the output is 8.

Hints:

Declare a variable named max_item to hold the max value seen so far. Update that value if you ever see a larger value.

Initialize that variable to any element's value, NOT to 0.
